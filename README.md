# Polars-GUI

A gui interface for [polars-rs](https://www.pola.rs/) Dataframes. This project
is inspired in the python [PandasGUI](https://pypi.org/project/pandasgui/)
library as a way to load Dataframes and perform basic data analysis and 
transformations.

PolarsGUI uses the [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) and
[eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/eframe) frameworks
for UI rendering.

## Current features
